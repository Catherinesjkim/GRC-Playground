# GRCLabs

**No PDFs. No gatekeeping. Just real-world, hands-on labs that help you understand GRC, security controls, and continuous authorization (cATO) one step at a time.**

Welcome to **GRC Labs**, a growing collection of beginner-friendly, tool-integrated labs designed to teach security and compliance concepts in a way that actually makes sense, even if you've never written a line of code or touched a control in your life.

If you're trying to understand how controls map to real tools, how policy as code works in the wild, or how continuous authorization actually plays out in the pipeline‚Ä¶ you're in the right place.

---

## Who This Is For

These labs are built for:
- GRC analysts trying to break into more technical workflows
- Engineers trying to understand how compliance fits into DevOps
- Teams working toward cATO and needing real-life examples
- Anyone who‚Äôs ever said, ‚ÄúWhat the heck is a control and how do I prove it?‚Äù

---

## What You'll Learn

Each lab walks you through:
- A **real-world problem** (like overly permissive S3 buckets)
- The **security control** it relates to
- A **policy or test** you can run (e.g., Rego with Conftest)
- How to **fix the problem**
- How to **prove the fix works**

And we keep it beginner-friendly. Everything is explained clearly and step-by-step, no experience required.
