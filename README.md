# GRCLabs

**No PDFs. No gatekeeping. Just real-world, hands-on labs that help you understand GRC, security controls, and continuous authorization (cATO) one step at a time.**

Welcome to **GRC Labs**, a growing collection of beginner-friendly, tool-integrated labs designed to teach security and compliance concepts in a way that actually makes sense, even if you've never written a line of code or touched a control in your life.

If you're trying to understand how controls map to real tools, how policy as code works in the wild, or how continuous authorization actually plays out in the pipeline… you're in the right place.

## Start Here (Beginner-Friendly)

New to GitHub? New to working with code at all? You're in the right place.

This entire repo is designed for GRC professionals, analysts, and curious minds who want to understand what GRC Engineering actually looks like without needing a computer science degree.

### What is GitHub?

Think of GitHub like Google Drive for code. This repo (aka this page) is like a shared folder, and inside are labs (folders) that contain exercises, files, and step-by-step guides.

Each lab folder includes a `README.md` file, that’s your instruction manual. You don’t need to install anything or clone the repo to follow along. You can view everything right from your browser.

## How to Use This Repo

1. Scroll down to the **Current Labs** section below.
2. Click on the lab that interests you.
3. Open the `README.md` file in that lab folder.
4. Follow the steps. These labs are hands-on, real-world, and built to teach by doing.

If you’re ever unsure what something means, that’s normal and that’s part of learning. Each lab is designed to meet you where you are, with clear explanations and practical examples.

## Feedback Welcome

This project is always evolving, and your feedback makes it better. If you try a lab and something doesn't make sense, or sparks an idea, open an issue or send me a DM on LinkedIn.

Let's learn together.

## Who This Is For

These labs are built for:
- GRC analysts trying to break into more technical workflows
- Engineers trying to understand how compliance fits into DevOps
- Teams working toward cATO and needing real-life examples
- Anyone who’s ever said, “What the heck is a control and how do I prove it?”

---

## What You'll Learn

Each lab walks you through:
- A real-world problem (like overly permissive S3 buckets)
- The security control it relates to
- A policy or test you can run (e.g., Rego with Conftest)
- How to fix the problem
- How to prove the fix works

And it's beginner-friendly. Everything is explained clearly and step-by-step, no experience required.
